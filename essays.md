# My Essays  
<p align="justify">Welcome to my collection of essays! Writing has always been a passion alongside coding. 
Throughout my life, I’ve written essays, investigations, stories, and scripts. 
My most significant work is my thesis, The Arava Project, which earned me my software engineering degree. 
Here, you’ll find many of my writings—feel free to explore!</p>

<i><b>IMPORTANT UPDATE: </b> Check out my last work, "AI’s Future Impact On Hollywood" This is an absorbing 
research that I will use to participate in the Bay Area Honors Symposium (BHC) 2025.</i>
