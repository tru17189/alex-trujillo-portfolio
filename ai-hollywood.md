   Imagine that you are watching a movie, your favorite actor or actress is in the lead
   role, and after an amazing feat he or she is able to save the world from its destruction, and
   everything returns to its status quo. In the epilogue of the movie, the main character is finally
   relaxing after such a big adventure, when out of nowhere, a mysterious character shows up.
   We don't have an idea of who this character is, whether it has good or bad intentions, or
   even if it is an enemy or an ally, but we can tell that something big is coming. Well, this is the
   situation that Hollywood is living in right now, and the mysterious character is better known
   as artificial intelligence, which from this point forward will be referred to as AI. This is the
   technology that will take over the world in the coming years, will change the world for
   everyone, and Hollywood is no exception, but what should Hollywood expect? Well, let‚Äôs
   take a look at the past, and try to answer this question.
  </p>

  <b>Hollywood And It Story With Technology</b>
  <p align="justify">
          In the last few years, we have heard a lot of news, and opinions of people afraid of
       AI. There is a group of people that believes that this new advanced technology is a threat for
       them and all the people who live from the movie industry. However, these types of reactions
       to technology innovations aren‚Äôt new; it is normal that people feel afraid or threatened when
       they perceive a fast new change in their environment. The truth is, that technology has been
       in Hollywood since the beginning, and has not always been well received. It started in the
       silent era from the late 1800s to the early 1920s. The technology in this era was pretty
       limited, so the filmmakers had to be very creative and innovate in order to achieve their
       craziest ideas. Surprisingly, they were able to get interesting results using alternative
      techniques that we are still using in our days, such as stop motion. One example is the
       movie ‚ÄòThe Lost World‚Äô (1925), as we can see in figure 1. Despite this lack of technology,
       they still were dependent on it. During this era, filmmakers used to film using hand cameras,
       and the audience used to watch through projectors. These projectors had a lower framerate
       (the number of individual frames or images displayed per second in a video or animation,
       better known as FPS) between 16 or 18 frames per second, instead of the 24 per second
       we use in the present.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Eventually, the introduction of the sounds era arrived. This era started in the late
     1920s, and because of technology the movie industry changed forever. Microphones were
     introduced, but many directors and actors weren‚Äôt happy with this new technology, because
     they had to change their approach to direct and act. However, the immersion that
     microphones brought to the movie industry was amazing, and all the retractors stayed
     behind while the industry continued. Something important to mention is, during this audio era
    engineers were introduced in the movie projects. The next big step for technology was the
     colors. This happened during the 1930s, when the technicolor process was introduced (fig
     2). Funny enough, this technology didn‚Äôt have an easy start either, but this time because of
     economical reasons, because the technology was expensive and complicated to use. Even
     when the audiences loved incredible successes such as ‚ÄòGone with the wind‚Äô, the colors
     didn‚Äôt become an immediate standard until the 1950s.
    </p>
    <center>Fig 2: Tecnicolor technique example</center>
    <p align="justify">
      Technology kept advancing, and eventually a big success would take over the
     world, a success from a company that actually wasn‚Äôt as known as it is presently. This
     company is Lucas films, and their success is known as ‚ÄúStar Wars.‚Äù This movie and other
     movies would show that computer generated imagery or CGI, were the next advancement.
     This technology is still used in a lot of production every year, but it is still creating debate.
     There is a big group that argues that the excessive use of CGI interferes with the story
     telling. On the other hand, there is another group that argues that CGI is necessary to tell a
     really immersive story. During this time, more specifically during the 90s, digital cameras
     were introduced. This was a huge impact for movie productions, because they make the
     whole process easier and simpler. Cameras became more resistant, more technological and
    smaller so now the filmmakers were able to move their cameras to every type of place, and
     edit their movies on computers, making the process way easier. Besides, film in digital is
     cheapest for the studios. However, there are still filmmakers and moviegoers that affirm that
     the digital revolution ruined cinema because they considered the old techniques had more
     quality and pureness. As we can see, technology has always been present and debated in
     the movie world. No technology has arrived free of controversy and discussion. In an
     industry as big as the movie industry, it‚Äôs hard to introduce new technology free of problems.
     There is always a group of people threatened by these new changes. The important
     question is, should movies slow down their evolution to protect their people?
    </p>

    <b> What Is AI?</b>
    <p align="justify">
       AI is the new technology that will take over the world. The impact of it is already
       generating every type of reaction inside the movie industry, but what exactly is AI? First, let‚Äôs
       introduce the two companies leading the AI race, OpenAI and Google. OpenAI introduces
       itself as ‚ÄúAI research and deployment company. Our mission is to ensure that artificial
       general intelligence benefits all of humanity.‚Äù (Open AI official webpage). This company
       introduced their model ‚ÄòChatGPT‚Äô as a ‚Äúpowerful conversational AI designed to interact with
       users in natural language. ChatGPT is based on GPT-3.5 and is fine-tuned through
       Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which involves human trainers
       curating conversations to optimize its responses‚Äù (ChatGPT). On the other hand, Google
       which is a technology company that works in several projects besides AI, introduces their AI
       model ‚ÄòGemini‚Äô as ‚Äúa significant advancement in AI, aiming to make it more helpful and
       accessible to everyone. The mission behind Gemini is to push the boundaries of AI
       capabilities while prioritizing safety and responsibility‚Äù (Gemini). These two answers were
       generated by their respective models, which means that is how the two AI present
       themselves. As we can see both companies have a different way to present their products,
       but with something in common, human interaction. Both chat GPT and Gemini need human
       interaction in order to work, which leads us to a more accurate explanation of what AI is.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      AI is a technology that can understand and respond to human language. It can learn
     from new information. It can act independently, and has the goal of replacing or assisting
     human intelligence. This technology is based on other technologies and needs a wide
     source of information in order to be trained. Two technologies important to highlight in order
     to understand AI are machine learning and deep learning. These two technologies are the
     previous step before reaching AI; both are data science techniques that have the goal of
     training an algorithm to mimic or imitate human intelligence and behavior.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       In the movie industry AI can assist in or entirely realize written works, such as write
       or fix a screenplay, pre production tasks, such as make a budget or pitch a movie, editing
       tasks, ect. As we can see AI can help, or directly realize many jobs inside the movie industry.
       Which can sound great for many people, but can be terrifying for another big group that are
       worried about the safety of their jobs.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      AI is definitely a powerful tool that will change the way we consume and watch
     movies, but also it will change how we produce movies. The latter is a change that most of
     us as audiences won‚Äôt notice. However, considering that making a movie involves many
     different disciplines, in this article we will discuss the effects that AI will have in five of them;
     VFXs or CGI, production design, audio design, make-up work, and stunts.
    </p>

    <b>How Will AI Change VFXs?</b>
    <p align="justify">
      VFX stands for visual effects, which is a process that involves altering images or
     videos for live action media such as movies or tv shows. VFX involves a variety of
     techniques such as CGI, green screen, motion capture, etc. As movies and technology have
     evolved, the use of VFXs have become more common in most productions, becoming a
     standard these days. Anyway, because not all the productions have the same budgets and
     times to work in their production, VFX artists have had to rely on technology to be able to do
     their work on time. The VFX industry flourish and grows when artists have more time to
     focus on their work, and with the introduction of CPUs VFXs artists have sped up their work
     as never before. AMD is leading this competition being the main producer of CPU available
    in the market, but what does CPUs do for VFXs? A single visual effects shot could have
     hundreds or more updates and it takes immense processing power. With the introduction of
     more powerful CPUs these processes have significantly reduced their duration. This gives
     the opportunity to VFXs artists to have more time to work in their art, and turn in better
     results, but how is AI related to all this? In a technological way, running an AI model can use
     a lot of processing power, of course CPUs are necessary in order to achieve this AI models
     run well. Now, AI and CPUs are vital components in the coming years for VFXs artists
     because they will improve the VFX process, reducing time, giving VFX artists more freedom
     to experiment, and reducing their carbon footprint.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       As was mentioned earlier, one of the main points of AI is to mimic human processes.
       The work of creating VFXs, is a work that takes many iterations and repetition. That means
       that many tasks are involved in the process, tasks that artists have to do many times. This
       could be inefficient and pointless, considering that AI tools are available because an AI is
       more relatable to a human if it is well trained. Why do artists have to waste their time making
       the same process several times when an AI can be trained to realize that process with a
       lower error percentage? VFXs artists should be able to use their time in a more meaningful
       way working on more important details and concepts that actually will make their work
       standout. In short words, the part of the work where human creativity is indispensable. On
       the other hand, it is undeniable that using an AI tool on the VFX process will take up the
       space and working pay hours that a VFX artist could be taking up. This can sound great for
       all the studios that want to save money, but it could be terrifying for all those VFX artists that
       are looking for a job.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       Every year thousands of movies and TV shows are produced, just U.S. and Canada
       produced around 700 titles per year. Most of this content needs VFX. Which means several
       hours of work and workers. The truth is that producing an audiovisual production is
       expensive, and depending on the scope can take a long time. Obviously, because
       entertainment in business studios are always looking to reduce their budgets and increase
       their earnings. In every business the best way to achieve that is reducing cost and time, so it
      is not a surprise that studios are very interested in implementing these AI tools that can
       replace human workers. Besides, an AI tool doesn‚Äôt need breaks, vacations, or sleep so
       studios could be able to finish all these productions in faster time than they used to take.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      At this point AI can sound like a real threat for VFX artists, and while that is not totally
     false, it would be alarmistic to say that AI just brings threats for VFX artists. As a matter of
     fact, AI will bring many amenities for artists. The more obvious one is that now artists will be
     able to reduce their workload. One of the biggest problems that the entertainment industry
     and other creative industries have always dragged is the ‚Äòcrunch‚Äô culture. What is the
     ‚Äòcrunch‚Äô culture? This is a term to refer to when VFX teams have an excessive workload,
     which involves long and intense periods of work, strict deadlines, and a lot of stress for the
     workers. These ‚Äòcrunch‚Äô moments can be real nightmares for the VFX artists. In this and
     other creative industries, these crunches have taken workers to permanently quit their jobs.
     AI tools can be a great relief for all VFX artists, because they can take a big part of the
     workload. Besides, artists can use their time in a more meaningful way, focusing only on the
     creative parts of the work that AI tools can‚Äôt manage.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       Finally, AI and CPUs technologies will reduce VFX‚Äôs footprints. In the article, ‚ÄúThe
       future of visual effects,‚Äù Ruczak, Knight (Academy and BAFTA member) explained how CPU
       technology will help to reduce entertainment industry footprints because of the performance
       improvement they bring. Faster, and more powerful computers means that artists can spend
       less time on their computer, reducing the amounts of energy they consume. Besides,
       traditionally movie industries have always used real location and material in order to achieve
       their effects, for example, a flood scene in a movie uses real water in order to be possible.
       This means that all that water is wasted. In the present, it would be really complicated to film
       a flood scene without waste water, because CGI technology still can‚Äôt achieve realistic
       effects. However, as AI technology advances we can dream of a future where no water has
       to be wasted in order to film a rain or flood scene. Another great example where AI can help
       the entertainment industry to reduce its footprint, is in the location creation process. Many
       audiovisual productions need to move whole teams to different locations in order to film a
      movie. That is why movies like Lord of the rings were filmed in New Zealand or part of Star
       Wars was filmed in the Guatemalan jungle. It is undeniable that big translations have an
       environmental impact, not only in the fuel used to travel, but also how these productions
       bother the environments where they are located. New technologies powered by AI, have the
       possibility to imitate these scenarios, making all these productions more eco-friendly and
       more affordable for the studios.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      In the present, AI is still far from achieving all these huge advancements because it
     can't replicate the realism of the practical effects. However, trusting to the ‚ÄòLaw of
     Accelerating Returns‚Äô by futurist Ray Kurzweil, technologies do not progress in a linear way,
     instead they progress in an exponential way, with each advance building on previous one.
     Based on this law, we can expect that AI technology can grow and be capable of reaching
     many of the more optimistics results. VFX studios must be smart enough to understand the
     attractiveness that these tools can be for the studios, mastering them first, and adapting
     them to be a tool that will make their work easier, instead of replacing them. Only in that way
     can we be able to avoid millions of VFX artists losing their jobs, and still have the benefit of
     curing many of the illnesses of the industry such as the ‚Äòcrunch‚Äô culture.
    </p>

    <b>How Will AI Change Production Design?</b>
    <p align="justify">
       Worlds such as Harry‚Äôs potter or Lord of the rings are so attractive because the
       elements inside them feel real. Yes, we as audiences know that orcs and wizards are not
       real, but we make a type of deal with these productions where we decide to buy the fantasy
       worlds they are presenting because they are well built. This goes beyond fantasy
       productions, we can believe that James Bond can save the world by himself because there
       is a whole pre-production process that makes sure to build the James Bond character and
       world well enough so we audiences can buy that story. We can buy that Martin McFly and
       Doc Brown can time travel because the pre-production team prepared a whole sci-fi
       explanation justifying this. The production design work is literally to prepare and build the
       whole world you are about to film, so audiences can make this deal with movies where they
      buy the fictional scenarios presented. Production design is critical even for non-fiction
       movies. Audiences can‚Äôt invest their attention in historical scenarios such as Titanic or
       Ben-Hur if the pre-production wouldn‚Äôt take the time to accurately recreate these scenarios,
       and the elements of these scenarios such as clothing and manner of speaking. How
       audiences will believe that two actors are in love, without a proper casting work that makes
       sure to get two actors with enough chemistry to pretend to be in love. Now, the question is
       how will AI affect this core part of a movie production?
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       We can summarize the production design process in script analysis, casting and
       location scouting, visual effects and post-production, and marketing and distribution. This
       part of the production is where the destiny of most of the movies is decided. It is really
       important for all the stakeholders to agree on what the project will be here, because that will
       decide the creative decision, the style, and pretty much the success of the project. In the
       coming years AI will have an important role in all the pre- and post-production process, but
       how exactly will it change the game?
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Script analysis is one of the first steps during the pre-production process. All movies
       need a script to know the path of the story, sense of the characters, the plot, the exciting
       cliffhangers, and of course the weak points. Analyze and edit the script, before starting the
       shootings, help productions to predict the success of a movie. In some movies there is a
       small group of writers or a writer who sharps the script, in other big projects there is a whole
       group of writers sharpening and proposing ideas to enhance the script. All this is done with
       the purpose of ensuring the movie‚Äôs success. Using deep learning AI can analyze hundreds
       of scripts and predict their potential success or failure. It is normal to think that for studios it
       is more reasonable to trust in an AI, to predict the destiny of their investment. It is important
       to remind readers and interested parties that movies are a business, without earnings the
       whole industry wouldn‚Äôt exist. It is important to mention this, because the use of AI to edit
       and improve a script can bring criticism from the more puristic moviegoers and filmmakers.
       In an artistic way, this is understandable, an AI can‚Äôt match the creativity levels that the
       human imagination can achieve, but even when these risky scripts can lead to unbelieve
      successes. They also can lead to catastrophic disasters. However, industry can find a big
       problem if they decide to trust too much in the AI‚Äôs judgment, because AI is an algorithm
       made to learn from past information, it is very likely that AI will always predict as ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô
       the same types of movies. This will lead to audiences starting to get tired of watching the
       same type of movies. Provoking that movies lose their strength versus other types of
       entertainment such as YouTube or video games.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Casting process plays one of the most important parts in a movie's success.
     Superstars and movies have always been related. Sometimes movies create superstars,
     and sometimes superstars create successful movies. Is not a coincidence that some actors
     seem to play the same type of roles in most of their movies. Studios sometimes make whole
     movie projects just thinking with one actor to play the main role, that is why we have so
     many action movies with the Rock or that Netflix did a $270 millions deal with Adam Sambler
     to keep shooting comedy movies. Audiences relate these actors with their genres, and the
     data have proven that those actors and those genres together can make big box offices. AI
     can predict very exactly any process where the data is available, and in casting there is a lot
     of historical data. Studios can rely on AI and its capacity to learn from old data to make their
     casting process more secure, ensuring that people actually want to see the actors they will
     see on the screen. However, there are limitations. The main one is that this AI benefit only
     would apply for big projects. When the studio or the stakeholders work on a smaller or
     independent project, where the budget can‚Äôt pay a superstar, the process of casting involves
     auditioning less famous or non-famous actors. Naturally, there is no data that can assure
     that these actors will connect with audiences or not. However, casting directors still can
     predict the possible success of a non-famous actor using AI based on the actor‚Äôs profile.
     Casting can use elements such as race, height, nationality, acting method, etc. to predict if
     their casting is the correct for the project. As a matter of fact, this can be really beneficial for
     independent movies that can project more of their investment, just relying on AI to double
     check their casting decisions.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      In the year 2016 IBM created the first movie trailer made for AI for the movie
     ‚ÄòMorgan‚Äô. As we know trailers are one of the main techniques studios use to hook audiences
     attention. Studios and directors have the obligation to make an engaging trailer that will
     make audiences want to watch the movie. Again thanks to all the data studios have collected
     about trailers performance, and the impact they have had in movie‚Äôs box offices, AI can use
     data science techniques to predict which scenes would be more effective in getting
     audiences attention, so directors can edit more engaging movie trailers. Here we can find
     one of the less controversial uses of AI inside the movie industry, due to the trailer's nature.
     Trailers are meant to sell the movie. They are a marketing tool. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a
     big or small production. You are interested in selling to as many people as possible.
     Probably, both independent and big studios can agree to use AI to enhance their trailers. It is
     in fact a good idea in order to protect their investments.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       During this section it has been mentioned how AI benefits from data, to predict and
       analyze a wide variety of things. This is because AI is made out of algorithms that have the
       power to recognize patterns, and learn from information in a way that human intelligence
       can‚Äôt. Therefore, can we assume AI is capable of building fictional worlds? or assist in
       building them? At the beginning of this section I discussed how the audience needs to come
       across a well built concept in order to believe the story that the movie is trying to tell. This
       means that there is tons of historical data of what has worked and what hasn't. As a matter
       of fact, human behavior can be predicted. This is because humans live under customs and
       routines, and our consuming patterns with entertainment are predictable as well. Using data
       science and AI, studios not only can predict what kind of stories will be successes, they also
       can predict in which regions and cultures they will be successes. It is normal to think that
       entertainment likes are not the same all around the world, but what does this mean for the
       future of production design? Honestly, it could mean many things that are hard to predict, but
       if something is safe to say is that the concepts that are more popular in the biggest markets
       such as America or China will start to be the standard around the world, or it could happen
       totally the opposite way. Audiences will start to receive more tailored movies for their
      regions, creating a bigger amount of content every year that can only be produced using an
       AI. It is hard to predict how AI will change the worlds and stories we watch in theaters, even
       when we can predict how it will change the process to make them. However, directors and
       studios must prepare to master AI if they want to keep up with the demanding amount of
       content that audiences ask for every year.
    </p>

    <b>How Will AI Change Audio Design?</b>
    <p align="justify">
       A good audiovisual production wouldn‚Äôt feel good without good audio, this sounds
       obvious but let‚Äôs stop to think about all the benefits that audio design means for movie‚Äôs
       industry. The first and more easy to appreciate is the soundtrack. Imagine movies like Star
       Wars or Indiana Jones without their iconic soundtrack made by John Williams. Some
       soundtracks are totally pillars for their movies, but audio design also is how we feel and hear
       the sounds in the movie. Bullet shots, thunders, punches, ect. All these little details need a
       sound effect that makes them feel real enough to make the viewer think ‚Äúdamn that was a
       hard punch‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don't really think he hurt him with that punch‚Äù because not all the punches
       have the same meaning in movies. What about dialogues? Maybe Marlon Brandon wouldn‚Äôt
       be scary enough during his first scene in the Godfather without a proper audio design which
       focuses his monologue as the only important noise in the room. Jordan Peele even
       mentioned once that the difference between comedy and horror is the music, so yes audio is
       as important as visuals in order to make a movie.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      As we have seen during this research, the strongest skill of the AI is to learn human
     tasks without getting tired. AI is used for audio designers to speed up the complicated
     process of audio design, for example, Skywalker sound, a part of Lucasfilm, used AI to
     categorize sounds from their library. AI also can predict which audios are more likely to be
     used during the editing process making it faster and easier for audio designers, and there
     are many more possibilities such as improving old audio files, converting audio files,
     transforming audio effects, noise suppression, ect. So far we can tell that AI will be a helpful
     tool for audio designers, but what about the creative part?
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The truth is that AI‚Äôs skill to learn makes it a powerful tool to generate new and
     precise soundtracks and sound effects. AI can use randomized algorithms alongside text
     inputs to generate new soundtracks in seconds, saving time and money for movie‚Äôs
     productions. However, there is an ethical problem in all this, and it is the same ethical
     problem that brings AI when it is involved in a creative process, plagiarism. There is a fine
     difference between inspiration and plagiarism. When inspiration is fine and innetable in every
     type of art, plagiarism is unethical and offensive, because it is similar to stealing. Composing
     a soundtrack such as writing a script, or building a concept convey an laborious creative
     work, where the talent of the people stands out. AI needs past data in order to generate
     things, no matter what audio, scripts, concepts, ect. The real dilemma is, doesn't the human
     brain also need past data to do the same? AI algorithms are made with the intention to
     imitate human intelligence. The big difference is that AI thinks in a linear way because it is
     made with programming, when human intelligence doesn‚Äôt. It can think in both ways linear
     and abstract. Based on this premise we can say that using AI is in fact plagiarism if it is used
     to generate new sounds, but also we can‚Äôt deny that some algorithms such as Neural
     Network are close to imitate how humans actually learn, and considering the law of
     accelerating returns, maybe someday AI will achieve it. However, in the current and the next
     years panorama audio designers still can make these questions in favor of creativity, and
     limit the use of AI with anything that its related with the creative process.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       Audio design involves many creative tasks, and a lot of laborers work in order to
       achieve great results. Movies wouldn‚Äôt be as magical as they are without the creativity and
       hard work of all the audio engineers and composers. AI has the potential to be a powerful
       tool in order to make audio design work easier but also can be a threat against their
       creativity and original ideas. The audio design industry must understand the implications that
       AI will have in their field, and adopt it as an ally before other groups make it an enemy.

    <b>How Will AI Change The Makeup Work?</b>
    <p align="justify">
       Have you ever wondered ‚ÄúHow do Hollywood's actors look well in all scenes?‚Äù
       Because no matter if they are about to drown while the Titanic is sinking in the back,
       Leonardo DiCaprio still looks stylish. Looks and styles are really important in movie
       productions, but this works in many ways; for example, Megan Fox and Shia Labeouf still
       can look very attractive even when they are all covered in dirt after the disaster that the
       Transformers did, Beetlejuice actually looks as someone who has been dead for years, or
       think of any period movie and how their characters have this distinguished makeup proper
       from that era. All these styles that help actors and actresses to make their acting more
       impressive, are the work made by the makeup artists. A good makeup job involves many
       things since the hairstyles, prosthetics, makeup, etc. Naturally, this is a field in movie
       productions that not many people think about when the AI revolution is mentioned because
       of its not-digital nature. So far, the past fields involve a computer in the process in order to
       be possible, but makeup work is not totally dependent on the technology in order to be
       possible. Makeup artists use technology to prepare and plan their works, but when they put
       into action their skills they don‚Äôt really need a computer or any other digital device, so how
       will AI affect makeup artists? Social media can provide us this answer.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       A filter is a technological tool that changes, enhances, or alters a video or picture in
       real time or post-processing. We can find the most common use of filters in social platforms
       such as Instagram or Snapchat. Filters work using technologies such as augmented reality
       and machine learning to modify in real time videos and pictures. Filters can imitate in a faster
       and cheaper way the same results that makeup produces. Of course it is possible to believe
       that a filter can achieve the same level of reality that some makeup works have achieved in
       some movie productions, but so far they are able to create very interesting effects that help
       millions of social media creators to keep stylish in their social media content. Besides, as
       other examples mentioned before, this technology will improve with the years, achieving
       more amazing results with the passing of time. However, filters are not even the most
       amazing technology that has the potential to threaten makeup artists.

    <p align="justify">
      The 2016 movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story presented a young version of
     Princess Leia played by Carrie Fisher who was 60 years old at that moment. More
     impressive than that, the character Wilhuff Tarkin had many scenes in the movie when the
     actor who plays it, Peter Cushing, was already dead. How was this possible? The answer is
     deepfake. Deep Fakes are images, videos, or audios edited or generated with the use of AI.
     Deepfake uses facial recognition algorithms alongside AI techniques in order to work; with
     the use of deepfake it is possible to generate new content from scratch, or modify already
     made content. This tool has proved to be very powerful, since with it, it is possible to
     generate content with humans that are not real, or make it look like a person is doing
     something that they never have done. On the internet there are many amazing examples of
     how deepfake works, such as a video of Donald Trump explaining how to wash money,
     Taken from a scene of Breaking Bad, or a Morgan Freeman video explaining the implications
     of deepfake, a video that Morgan Freeman wasn't part of. One of the biggest advantages
     that deepfake has over the traditional makeup work is that deepfake can also imitate the
     voices. In the future, it is very likely that the studios will start to produce more biographical
     movies that will look like the character is actually there; for example, with deepfake, it would
     be possible to film a Michael Jackson movie with his face and voice, but without him.
     However, deepfake is still a relatively new technology, and many legal points haven‚Äôt been
     clarified, and have proved to be controversial because of the kind of content that many
     internet users have created with it. The more notorious example is all the pornographic
     content with celebrities. However, there is a very important precedent that will be used as an
     example for the future of deepfake and AI, and that is the Bruce Willis case. The famous
     actor Bruce Willis was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, a rare group of disorders
     that doesn‚Äôt have a cure because of that the actor‚Äôs health has been deprecated. However,
     in the year 2021 the Russian phone company MegaFon released an ad where we can see a
     young and strong version of Bruce Willis in it. This was made by the company Deepcake,
     which used a deepfake actor to create a whole ad using the rights of the image of Bruce
     Willis.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The implications of this could be really positive for some actors, and very prejudicial
     for others. In the case of Bruce Willis he can still generate income even when his health
     doesn't let him do it. Voice actors could still work even if their throats can‚Äôt reach the tones
     they used to reach; they only need to sell the rights of their voices. Even when this could
     sound very positive for some groups, what happens with the new talents? Are we destined to
     watch the same faces forever because it is easier for studios to sell a movie with an already
     famous actor than with a new talent? Usually, the industry takes the path that ensures the
     most profit. As has been mentioned before, the entertainment industry is a business. They
     have the obligation of being sustainable over time. It is probable that independent projects
     will rather use technology like deepfake in order to save money in the makeup work. Now,
     big blockbusters will still use makeup work because it still can reach levels that deepfake
     can‚Äôt. Anyways, a constant in this whole topic is the fact that technology improves at a fast
     speed. Makeup artists can find ways where their work and the AI benefits can combine in
     order to achieve more impressive results. Fashion, style, makeup, etc. come from the
     human‚Äôs creativity, so far it is impossible that an AI can generate all the crazy and unique
     concepts that makeup artists do. However, because of the business nature of the industry
     makeup artists must find a way to involve their work alongside the new technologies to keep
     relevant for studios and productions.
    </p>

    <b>How Will AI Change Stunt Performers?</b>
    <p align="justify">
       Movies are made to surprise us. Since, a romantic story that will make us dream to
       find our other side to a drama that will make us cry. The whole point of making a good or
       even a bad movie is to make the audience feel something. A common resource that movies
       use to achieve this are action scenes. Since, the typical choreographed fight where the hero
       defeats ten minions, or a car race where the main character is risking his or her life. For
       years, in order to film these types of scenes, studios have used stunt performers willing to
       risk their health in order to make these types of scenes as real as possible. Let‚Äôs remember
       that CGI and VFX have not always been around; in the past if you wanted to film a scene
       where a car explodes, you had to explode a car. Superstars, protagonists, and actors in
       general are a core part of a movie‚Äôs success. There are many reasons for that such as they
       are the main marketing point to sell the movie, studios need the actors to make a campaign
       to sell the movie, or they need the actors to keep safe during the whole filming process so
       they can finish the movie. Therefore, studios can‚Äôt risk their actors' health no matter what, so
       in order to still film these types of scenes they use stunt performers.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       A stunt performer or stunt professional is a person who has the ability to do a risky
       act without end harm. Of course, because of the nature of the work they always have the risk
       of end harm, and actually this happens sometimes. Anyway, there are many people out
       there willing to do this job that keeps the entertainment industry alive. With the introduction
       of AI, these stunt performers have the risk of being less necessary in order to achieve these
       scenes; this is because of how AI has improved the VFX industry, and because of that it is
       easier for VFX groups to make these scenes without having to make the actual scene in the
       real life. For example, if a director needs to film a scene where the protagonist is riding a
       bike at maximum speed, while this is dodging all the cars on the way, with AI and VFX is not
       necessary anymore to get a stunt performer to do that. Now, you can generate the cars
       using CGI, film the protagonist riding a bike on an empty street, and then in post-production
       add the cars. This is actually good news in many ways, because thanks to that there is no
       need to put someone's life at risk.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       In the year 1982, during the filming of the movie ‚ÄúThe Twilight Zone: The Movie‚Äù the
       actor Vic Morrow and two child actors, Myca Dinh Le and Renee Shin-Yi Chen died filming a
       scene for the movie. John Landis, the director of that part of the movie, was filming a scene
       set in the Vietnam War. The scene consisted of the three actors escaping from a helicopter.
       In order to make the scene possible, a real helicopter piloted by a Vietnam War veteran was
       used, because a mistake related to an explosion detonated at the wrong time. The helicopter
       lost control, and crashed against the actors taking the lives of them and the people inside the
       helicopter. This is one of the most tragic moments in Hollywood history, but unfortunately
       incidents like this have happened more times. Movies such as XXX, The Wizard Of Oz, or
      more recently the never-released movie Rust have had incidents like this. The origin of these
       incidents comes from the necessity that movies have to film these types of scenes, and the
       only alternative they have is to recreate them. With the integration of AI, studios can recreate
       these scenes using digital components that will not risk anyone‚Äôs life. Besides, this could be
       an economical relief for studios that can save money, skipping to film expensive scenes like
       these. Another important thing to mention is that this scene has an environmental impact
       that can be avoided.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       The big problem with all this, is the same problem that always follows AI, human
       replacement. Something constant in this paper is the fact that AI can‚Äôt replicate human
       creativity and essence. There are many stunt professionals that live off this, and the
       integration of AI can lead to them losing their jobs. Besides, there is a uniqueness
       component that stunt performances bring that AI can replicate. It is not easy for directors to
       plan ahead these scenes that involve a lot of improvisation; they have an idea of what they
       want to film, but they can‚Äôt control in totality the final outcome. This has led to great scenes
       even better and more natural than directors were expecting. An AI generated scene is totally
       scripted, and the improvisation factor is lost. For many creatives or artists this is
       non-negotiable; they will always look for the authenticity. However, studios can push them to
       use AI in order to save as much money as possible.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      There are many good reasons to implement AI in scenes that need stunt performers;
       One reason is the safety of the people involved must always be a priority for the studios.
       However, the people of the industry can‚Äôt forget one of their most important communities, a
       community that has kept them safe. The solution here is the collaboration between stunt
       performances and AI. A collaboration that can lead movies to find a way to keep filming
       these scenes in the most safe way possible but ensuring the authenticity that creatives and
       audiences love.
    </p>

    <b>Interview With A Former Hollywood Worker</b>
    <p align="justify">
      As part of this investigation, I had the opportunity to interview a former Hollywood
     worker, and ask his opinion about this topic. This person was Adam Paul. Adam Paul is an
     actor, writer and director that now works as acting teacher for the University of Nevada film
     department. He was involved in productions such as ‚ÄòHow I met your mother‚Äô or ‚ÄòHollywood
     Residential‚Äô.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       I had the opportunity to interview Adam via a video call, and ask his opinion about AI
       and the entertainment industry. First, I asked Adam about his general opinion of AI in the
       movies industry and if he has ever been in a production where AI was used. Adam told me
       that he never had worked in a production where AI was used. However, he mentioned that
       he has experimented with AI. Specifically, cloning his voice. Currently, Adam is recording an
       audio book, so he had the opportunity to clone his voice using an AI software. He mentioned
       that he thinks that AI can be a helpful tool to assist this type of work, but he is afraid that this
       tool is becoming the only tool. A way that Adam used to explain is that ‚ÄúAn actors‚Äô entire job
       is to represent humanity and what it is to be human‚Äù this is definitely an interesting quote,
       because it shows how from the point of view of an actor AI lacks humanity. An example he
       provides is motion capture, a class he teaches. Adam mentioned that there are companies
       that can simulate human movements and expressions using AI technology; which makes
       human involvement less necessary, perse taking out ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù from the process. Another
       fear he shares is how companies are trying to replicate human interaction with AI, which in
       his opinion is a dangerous move towards actors and actresses, because that is literally their
       job. Adam supports his opinions explaining that his job as a professor is to teach students to
       get and understand the singularity of their contribution.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      After this first question, I presented to Adam two hypothetical scenarios. The first
     scenario was about a voice actor who is losing his ability to make the voices he used to
     make, so he decided to sell the rights of his voice to continue proofing with his voice. The
     Second scenario was about an foreign actor who has an accent barrier that lowers his
     opportunities to get a Hollywood job, so with the use of AI studios could hire this actor and
     get rid of his accent using AI in post production. Adam thinks these are not ideal scenarios,
     because the use of AI will inevitably block someone else's growth. If humanity it‚Äôs an integral
     part of acting and movies, blocking an actor from giving the job to an AI would be something
     very wrong in his opinion. Therefore, he encourages actors and actresses with language
     barriers to embrace their differences and make them special, because in Adam‚Äôs beliefs
     what makes an actor special is the singularity they can bring to the productions. He finally
     finished answering this question saying that we should treat AI with the same responsibility
     as we treat nuclear weapons, because of the strong impact they can have in our lives.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Then, I asked Adam about which areas of movie production will be more impacted for
     AI. He first said that he thinks all of them will be impacted at the same level. Some examples
     he provided was the deal that Lionsgate did with the company Runway. Lionsgate will use
     Runway‚Äôs AI to analyze Lionsgate‚Äôs scripts, and with them generate new scripts that have
     more chances to be a success, this of course would impact screenwriters. He also
     mentioned how editors, musicians and sound producers will be impacted, because with AI
     this job can be replicated using less people in the process. He thinks that musicians are a
     group that has been impacted strongly in the present, because there are many examples
     that now anyone can generate music that sounds like a specific musician just using AI.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The next question was about blockbusters. A blockbuster is a production that
     involves huge investment in order to be a film, some examples of blockbusters are
     Avengers, or Avatar. Two of the most successful movies of all time. I asked Adam if he thinks
     that AI will make it more affordable to film this type of movie, considering that it‚Äôs always a
     risk to film a movie with such huge investment. Adam mentioned that it is natural to think that
     AI will make a more affordable blockbuster. An example he gave me was Marvel movies. He
     mentioned that usually in a Marvel movie at the end there is a huge battle or war where
     many things are happening at the same time, like a building being cut in half, so with AI
     generating this type of images it would be easier and faster to film scenes like this. During
     his answer, he mentioned a concept called ‚Äòopposition of ideas‚Äô. Adam thinks that something
     interesting that studios or independent creators can achieve with AI is take the opposite of
     really different ideas and make a more complex product fusion them. After this, he
     mentioned how even when AI can help small creators to achieve bigger products, and still be
     profitable, there is something that they put at risk, the unexpected. A concept that he
     explains it‚Äôs really important for genres like comedies or horrors. This is because AI uses
     past data to generate its outcome, so it is natural to think that the ‚Äòunexpected‚Äô factor that it‚Äôs
     important for the most of the genres, will be lost in the middle.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       After this, we moved to talk about independent creators, and if they can use AI to cut
       the threshold they have versus a Hollywood production. Adam thinks that yes, they can use
       AI to save money and make their productions more affordable. The only concern he has with
       this, is how much they will use AI. Adam explains that if these young creators have an
       excessive use of AI in their projects they will eventually lose themselves in all the things that
       AI is making for them. Instead, he thinks it is better to use AI as a resource to save money
       and time, but far from the creative part which should be made by humans.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      After that we talked about safeness, and if AI can help studios to keep all the
     stakeholders safer during the film. I mentioned three movies to Adam. The Wizard of oz
     (1939), The twilight zone: The movie (1983), and The omen (1976). These three movies are
     well known to have accidents, or bad decisions that lead to some people being injured, sick,
     or even die. Adam believes that AI can be a solution to get more safety in movie
     productions. He pointed out the accident happened in the movie Rust (2024) where Alec
     Balwin killed a person with a real gun by accident. Adam thinks that elements like guns can
     be replaced for technology or other alternatives in order to ensure production‚Äôs safety.
     However, he also thinks that this use has to be measured, because mistakes and accidents
     are part of filming. He believes that actors, directors and production teams can learn a lot
     from mistakes.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Then we talked about creativity. I asked Adam if he believes that AI is a menace to
     creativity. He told me that yes, that AI is a threat for creativity. He summarized it like
     imagination is the source of the best human ideas. AI lacks imagination, so that will lead the
     industry to film movies without creativity.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The last question was, should studios create an ‚ÄúAI producer‚Äù that supervises the use
     of AI in movies, so they can ensure that AI is being used in the proper way and amounts.
     Adam thinks that would be a great idea, and a possible solution for the AI controversy. He
     also thinks that a position like that should even be in the government, a person that can
     supervise the AI in general.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      As we can see from Adam, the people who are part of the industry have many fears
     and questions of how AI will affect their industry. Obviously, this is understandable, because
     they live off this, and for most of them this is their passion. Also, we can observe that in this
     particular case Adam is not close to AI use in movies. He pointed out many good examples
     where AI can be used in movies. Interviews like this, make us realize that there is still a very
     mysterious way to walk, and many things to set up. It is a fact that AI will be part of the
     industry in the future, and it is a reality in the present, but creatives and artists like Adam are
     trying to ensure that this tool becomes an ally and not an enemy.
    </p>

    <b>Conclusions</b>
    <p align="justify">
       It is hard to try to fight against such a powerful technology as AI is. Human
       technological evolution has never stopped, and it is very unlikely that AI will be the
       exception. However, what does this mean for Hollywood? or more importantly what does this
       mean for studios, talents, production workers, and audiences? because there is a different
       lecture of this situation for each of them.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      First, the studios are companies that will always look to protect their investments, and
     make revenue. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are small or big studios; their main goal is going to be
     to generate earnings. Otherwise, they are destined to disappear. It is safe to say that the
     studios will continue pushing forward the integration of AI, because the savings of money
     and time AI represents for their budgets.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Second, some talents can still feel safe in the near future. AI is still far from replacing
     some types of talents such as actors and directors because the type of work they do is still
     quite complicated to be totally replicated by an AI. These types of talents are still on time to
    push laws that protect them from unfair uses of AI against their works, but more importantly,
     they are still on time to understand the implications that AI will have in a more distant future,
     and educate themselves and adapt their work to this inevitable change. Other types of
     talents such as makeup artists and writers should be more alert of the changes that are
     happening and the changes that are about to happen, because their works have already
     been very well imitated by the AI. However, this conclusion is not trying to be alarmistic
     about this last type of talent. As was discussed in the paper, if these associations work
     together and find solutions to adapt the AI in their work, they run with less risk that outsider
     companies will try to replace them with their AIs. The education and adaptation to the new
     tendencies is always key in keeping a job relevant to the matter of the field.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       Third, the production workers must have a similar reflection in order to keep relevant.
       Again the integration of such powerful technology as AI in their fields is almost impossible to
       stop; even more so considering many of these jobs such as VFX artists are directly related
       with technology. However, this latter fact is good news for them, because they have the
       technological skills and knowledge to learn and master the AI, and to understand the
       implications of it in their work. Even more important than that, they can use it to cure the
       probably biggest illness in their industry, the ‚Äòcrunch‚Äô culture, an illness that has ended
       careers forever.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       Finally, audiences play the most important role in all this situation. As Adam told me
       in the interview we had, their economic answer is the one that will drive all this situation to its
       natural evolution. If audiences like and adopt movies with a strong AI influence, this type of
       movies will be more common. Otherwise, the AI use will be limited for specific tasks.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
       Movies is an industry that many love around the world. Unlike other industries, the
       product they make is one that has the chance to connect with their consumers in emotional
       ways. In order to protect this beloved industry, and just make it progress with the AI
       assistance, all the stakeholders and audiences have to learn the implications, ethics, and the
       possible consequences that will keep the movie industry in the right way to continue
       evolving.
