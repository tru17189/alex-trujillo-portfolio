       Imagine that you are watching a movie, your favorite actor or actress is in the lead
   role, and after an amazing feat he or she is able to save the world from its destruction, and
   everything returns to its status quo. In the epilogue of the movie, the main character is finally
   relaxing after such a big adventure, when out of nowhere, a mysterious character shows up.
   We don't have an idea of who this character is, whether it has good or bad intentions, or
   even if it is an enemy or an ally, but we can tell that something big is coming. Well, this is the
   situation that Hollywood is living in right now, and the mysterious character is better known
   as artificial intelligence, which from this point forward will be referred to as AI. This is the
   technology that will take over the world in the coming years, will change the world for
   everyone, and Hollywood is no exception, but what should Hollywood expect? Well, let‚Äôs
   take a look at the past, and try to answer this question.

  <b>Hollywood And It Story With Technology</b>
  <p align="justify">
          In the last few years, we have heard a lot of news, and opinions of people afraid of
       AI. There is a group of people that believes that this new advanced technology is a threat for
       them and all the people who live from the movie industry. However, these types of reactions
       to technology innovations aren‚Äôt new; it is normal that people feel afraid or threatened when
       they perceive a fast new change in their environment. The truth is, that technology has been
       in Hollywood since the beginning, and has not always been well received. It started in the
       silent era from the late 1800s to the early 1920s. The technology in this era was pretty
       limited, so the filmmakers had to be very creative and innovate in order to achieve their
       craziest ideas. Surprisingly, they were able to get interesting results using alternative
      techniques that we are still using in our days, such as stop motion. One example is the
       movie ‚ÄòThe Lost World‚Äô (1925), as we can see in figure 1. Despite this lack of technology,
       they still were dependent on it. During this era, filmmakers used to film using hand cameras,
       and the audience used to watch through projectors. These projectors had a lower framerate
       (the number of individual frames or images displayed per second in a video or animation,
       better known as FPS) between 16 or 18 frames per second, instead of the 24 per second
       we use in the present.

      Eventually, the introduction of the sounds era arrived. This era started in the late
     1920s, and because of technology the movie industry changed forever. Microphones were
     introduced, but many directors and actors weren‚Äôt happy with this new technology, because
     they had to change their approach to direct and act. However, the immersion that
     microphones brought to the movie industry was amazing, and all the retractors stayed
     behind while the industry continued. Something important to mention is, during this audio era
    engineers were introduced in the movie projects. The next big step for technology was the
     colors. This happened during the 1930s, when the technicolor process was introduced (fig
     2). Funny enough, this technology didn‚Äôt have an easy start either, but this time because of
     economical reasons, because the technology was expensive and complicated to use. Even
     when the audiences loved incredible successes such as ‚ÄòGone with the wind‚Äô, the colors
     didn‚Äôt become an immediate standard until the 1950s.

      Technology kept advancing, and eventually a big success would take over the
     world, a success from a company that actually wasn‚Äôt as known as it is presently. This
     company is Lucas films, and their success is known as ‚ÄúStar Wars.‚Äù This movie and other
     movies would show that computer generated imagery or CGI, were the next advancement.
     This technology is still used in a lot of production every year, but it is still creating debate.
     There is a big group that argues that the excessive use of CGI interferes with the story
     telling. On the other hand, there is another group that argues that CGI is necessary to tell a
     really immersive story. During this time, more specifically during the 90s, digital cameras
     were introduced. This was a huge impact for movie productions, because they make the
     whole process easier and simpler. Cameras became more resistant, more technological and
    smaller so now the filmmakers were able to move their cameras to every type of place, and
     edit their movies on computers, making the process way easier. Besides, film in digital is
     cheapest for the studios. However, there are still filmmakers and moviegoers that affirm that
     the digital revolution ruined cinema because they considered the old techniques had more
     quality and pureness. As we can see, technology has always been present and debated in
     the movie world. No technology has arrived free of controversy and discussion. In an
     industry as big as the movie industry, it‚Äôs hard to introduce new technology free of problems.
     There is always a group of people threatened by these new changes. The important
     question is, should movies slow down their evolution to protect their people?

    <b> What Is AI?</b>
    <p align="justify">
       AI is the new technology that will take over the world. The impact of it is already
       generating every type of reaction inside the movie industry, but what exactly is AI? First, let‚Äôs
       introduce the two companies leading the AI race, OpenAI and Google. OpenAI introduces
       itself as ‚ÄúAI research and deployment company. Our mission is to ensure that artificial
       general intelligence benefits all of humanity.‚Äù (Open AI official webpage). This company
       introduced their model ‚ÄòChatGPT‚Äô as a ‚Äúpowerful conversational AI designed to interact with
       users in natural language. ChatGPT is based on GPT-3.5 and is fine-tuned through
       Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which involves human trainers
       curating conversations to optimize its responses‚Äù (ChatGPT). On the other hand, Google
       which is a technology company that works in several projects besides AI, introduces their AI
       model ‚ÄòGemini‚Äô as ‚Äúa significant advancement in AI, aiming to make it more helpful and
       accessible to everyone. The mission behind Gemini is to push the boundaries of AI
       capabilities while prioritizing safety and responsibility‚Äù (Gemini). These two answers were
       generated by their respective models, which means that is how the two AI present
       themselves. As we can see both companies have a different way to present their products,
       but with something in common, human interaction. Both chat GPT and Gemini need human
       interaction in order to work, which leads us to a more accurate explanation of what AI is.
