       Imagine that you are watching a movie, your favorite actor or actress is in the lead
   role, and after an amazing feat he or she is able to save the world from its destruction, and
   everything returns to its status quo. In the epilogue of the movie, the main character is finally
   relaxing after such a big adventure, when out of nowhere, a mysterious character shows up.
   We don't have an idea of who this character is, whether it has good or bad intentions, or
   even if it is an enemy or an ally, but we can tell that something big is coming. Well, this is the
   situation that Hollywood is living in right now, and the mysterious character is better known
   as artificial intelligence, which from this point forward will be referred to as AI. This is the
   technology that will take over the world in the coming years, will change the world for
   everyone, and Hollywood is no exception, but what should Hollywood expect? Well, letâ€™s
   take a look at the past, and try to answer this question.

  <b>Hollywood And It Story With Technology</b>
  <p align="justify">
          In the last few years, we have heard a lot of news, and opinions of people afraid of
       AI. There is a group of people that believes that this new advanced technology is a threat for
       them and all the people who live from the movie industry. However, these types of reactions
       to technology innovations arenâ€™t new; it is normal that people feel afraid or threatened when
       they perceive a fast new change in their environment. The truth is, that technology has been
       in Hollywood since the beginning, and has not always been well received. It started in the
       silent era from the late 1800s to the early 1920s. The technology in this era was pretty
       limited, so the filmmakers had to be very creative and innovate in order to achieve their
       craziest ideas. Surprisingly, they were able to get interesting results using alternative
      techniques that we are still using in our days, such as stop motion. One example is the
       movie â€˜The Lost Worldâ€™ (1925), as we can see in figure 1. Despite this lack of technology,
       they still were dependent on it. During this era, filmmakers used to film using hand cameras,
       and the audience used to watch through projectors. These projectors had a lower framerate
       (the number of individual frames or images displayed per second in a video or animation,
       better known as FPS) between 16 or 18 frames per second, instead of the 24 per second
       we use in the present.

      Eventually, the introduction of the sounds era arrived. This era started in the late
     1920s, and because of technology the movie industry changed forever. Microphones were
     introduced, but many directors and actors werenâ€™t happy with this new technology, because
     they had to change their approach to direct and act. However, the immersion that
     microphones brought to the movie industry was amazing, and all the retractors stayed
     behind while the industry continued. Something important to mention is, during this audio era
    engineers were introduced in the movie projects. The next big step for technology was the
     colors. This happened during the 1930s, when the technicolor process was introduced (fig
     2). Funny enough, this technology didnâ€™t have an easy start either, but this time because of
     economical reasons, because the technology was expensive and complicated to use. Even
     when the audiences loved incredible successes such as â€˜Gone with the windâ€™, the colors
     didnâ€™t become an immediate standard until the 1950s.
