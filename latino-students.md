  Being a student is a challenge. In order to achieve in your student life, you have to
   study, practice, network, and overcome the different obstacles you will come across, so it is
   normal that the students feel insecurities and pressure sometimes. Although, for some
   groups of students the level of pressure can be even higher than for the rest, that is the case
   of the minority groups. This article will focus on one group in particular, Latinos. Since the
   foundation of the United States, immigration has been a core factor in the success and
   construction of the country. However; Latinos still have to struggle with many stereotypes
   that may be affecting their learning process. From the most common stereotypes they have
   to face in America or the perspective their peers have of them as ‘Latino students’, also let’s
   go over where these stereotypes come from.
</p>
<p align="justify>
   First, we have to know, what is a ‘student’? The Cambridge dictionary describes it as
   “a person who is studying at a school, college, or university”. Second, it is important to know
   what is a ‘Latino’? Again the Cambridge dictionary describes it as “someone who lives in the
   U.S. and who comes from, or whose family comes from, Latin America”. Based on these two
   definitions we can say that a Latino student is someone who has a background from a Latino
   country, studying in a college or school. Here we can find something interesting. Since the
   beginning, this group has been labeled. They have been labeled under whatever stereotypes
   the society has about this region. Unfortunately, this ‘labeling’ is harmful for their learning
   process. It is well known that students need to feel confidence in themselves in order to
   maximize their learning. As is explained in the article Stereotype Threat “Students who are
   confident they belong in a learning community and feel valued by their teachers and peers
   are able to engage more fully in the classroom”. So it is normal to think that a student who is
   perceived under negative stereotypes will feel a lack of confidence during their learning
   process, because they will have a sensation of ‘not belonging’ with their learning community,
   and also their effort to learn will feel not valued. Therefore, their performance will be worse.

   It is easier to understand the ‘Latino Student’ stereotype, understanding first the
   typical Latino stereotypes, and applying these ideas over what to expect of a student. First, it
   is important to say that these stereotypes are unfair, not just because you shouldn't label a
   person based on your beliefs of its culture, they are also unfair because they cage a whole
   region with many different cultures in the same stereotypes. It is a common mistake from
   many Americans to believe that all the Latino cultures are the same. This is a thought that
   even important politicians have had. Antonio Menéndez showed this, using a Ronald
   Reagan anecdote as an example “Ex-president Ronald Reagan, after a tour of several Latin
   American countries, was surprised to find that the countries were different from one another
   (Goodwin 12).” It seems that for some politicians and people there is no interest to really
   understand what makes every Latino Country different, and it’s simpler just to cage all of
   them under the Mexican’s Stereotypes. This could be a really heartbreaking experience for
   many students from South and Central America, and the Caribbean, who are often put into
   stereotypes that are not even related to their cultures, but where do these stereotypes come
   from? Antonio Menéndez explained it like this:
</p>
<p align="justify>
  <i>
     People in the United States tend to explain all of Latin America in terms of the
     nationalities or countries that they know. For instance, most US citizens in the
     Midwest and Southwest perceive Latin American culture through the Mexicans they
     know; in the East, particularly in the New York and Boston areas, people see Latin
     American culture through their limited interactions with Dominicans and Puerto
     Ricans; in Miami, Cubans and Central Americans...
     (Menéndez, 73).

   Based on this we can understand that these stereotypes come from the interaction that the
   American people have had with the Latinos surrounding them, which actually make sense.
   People will perceive things as they see it. Probably, in this simple fact, comes the biggest
   and most dangerous of all the problems “oversimplification”.
</p>
<p align="justify>
  The story of the Latino immigration in the US comes from the needs that these
   people had in their country of origin, needs that originated from the unequal and corrupt
   governments that many of these countries have had. Millions of people looking for a better
   life, decided to move to the closest first world country, and others were already there since
   the beginning because of the fact that some US states used to be part of Mexico, such as
   California and Texas. All these people who came from these poor and outcast backgrounds,
   arrived here willing to make any type of job available, oversimplifying them as the people
   who do the jobs that Americans don’t want to do. Besides, because of their backgrounds,
   many of these people came uneducated, so the american society started to label them as
   hard but not smart workers, giving birth to the most common Latino Stereotype. It is
   important to clarify that the background before described does not apply for all the Latino
   immigrants, in many areas of the country we can find historical and modern examples of well
   educated or wealthy Latinos that had developed their careers in the country. Anyways, time
   has passed, and the reasons why Latino people immigrate to America have changed. Yes,
   there is still a big group of them looking for better opportunities they don’t have in their
   original countries, but another big group is looking to use their engineering, scientific, artistic,
   etc. skills in new and bigger scenarios. Sadly, most of the time this last group is still unfairly
   caged in the same stereotypes. Besides, there is another important group we can’t forget. All
   the sons and daughters of all the original immigrants who have grown up under the
   American educational system, and still are labeled under the same stereotypes which were
   used to label their parents.

   Is there a solution for this problem? Melissa Alarcon exposed a possible solution in
   her article named Stereotypes “Similarly, taking the perspective of another person inhibits
   both stereotype activation and application.” These dangerous stereotypes can be inhibited,
   using the same thing that originated this article, education. If the problem is the self-esteem
   and auto-perception of the Latino students it is hurt because of the stereotypes. We can use
   the education itself, to change their and the rest of the students' mindset. Realistically, it is
   impossible to teach all the Latino american cultures in the American educational system,
   because there are many countries. Instead, an open-mind and open to discussion culture
   can be taught. If the problem is the perception that people build based on only what they
   see, we can teach the future generations to not be afraid to ask about their classmates'
   cultures. Making this process of stereotypes disintoxication more tailored, and focus in all the
   different communities of the US. If Latino students can have the freedom and pride to talk
   about their backgrounds, since they are kids, they will grow up feeling as smart and
   capables as their peers. Stereotypes can hurt whole communities, and stop the progress of
   the society. Millions of talented professionals, and potential talented professionals are
   blocked every year during their growth because of unfair and ignorant stereotypes, taking
   from the world the opportunity to enjoy all the marvelous things they have to offer.
