  During my last year of highschool, when I was about to graduate. I felt for the first
   time what it is to make a decision that can change your life. An “adult decision” I used to
   think. “Which major should I study?” That was the question. Now, when I think about it, it’s
   interesting how much influenced I was for my parents and the society in general because I
   never considered another option. I honestly believe that the university is not the only way we
   have to make our dreams real, even so, that was the way I chose, and I would do it again. I
   still remember that senior student I used to be, being scared to death of not being accepted
   to the university, that I wanted to be accepted. In Guatemala there are several universities
   you can attend, but I was focused on only one “La universidad del valle de Guatemala”,
   probably the most prestigious university in the country. In order to be accepted, you had to
   write an essay about why you would be a good fit, and pass the admission exam with a good
   grade. If you do all that, congratulations you will be accepted. That was the beginning of
   what would be my new college life, all the admission process, my first job opportunity, my
   final thesis project, and trying to balance all that at the same time.

   I remember nostalgically those study meetings with my friends who were also trying
   to be accepted. The pressure I felt during that process was high, funny enough, it is also one
   of the lowest pressures I have felt in my life. With the years I would come across with bigger
   pressures during my university life. I guess humans are beings of perspectives. In that year
   the university was promoting itself announcing that one former group of students were going
   to launch the first Guatemalan satellite to space. I remember finding myself thinking “How
   am I going to impress them when they educate a group of people capable of launching a
   satellite?” I understood what impostor syndrome is for the first time, but I have a dad who
   removed the phrase “give up” from the dictionary of my brain, so I did my best, and I made it.
   I had been accepted. I was proud, happy, and excited. I told everybody about it. I even
   remember that I felt bad for a friend that didn’t make it, but in a selfish way, that was
   secondary. The happiness I was feeling was huge. It was a good moment, but with the years
   I would discover that being accepted is the easy part. Getting out with a title in your hands,
   that is the hard part.

<p align="justify">
  That short story led me to my senior year. The years shaped me, and I passed from
   being an excited and motivated freshman to being a more cynical and tired senior student.
   The final chapter of this epic journey called “university years” was about to come. I was
   ready but tired as an old warrior would be before his final battle, but as the warrior the fear
   wasn’t an option anymore, and I was ready for this final adversary better known as “The
   thesis project”.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  A thesis project is one of the ways students have to get their diplomas. It consists in
   developing a never made project, and defend it in front of a trio of professionals. This project
   takes around a year to be done. It takes a lot of preparation and time in order to finish it, but
   because humans have that bad habit of not living in the present, I was focused on another
   business. If you study a university program, you know that everybody who is older than you
   will tell you “theory is good but experience is the real deal” and because I’m older from the
   first time I heard this, I will confirm it. What I’m trying to say is that I had just got my first
   software engineering job. I was developing a group of apps alongside Guatemala's
   international airport. We were a relatively new team in the company, and because the
   performance so far had been good. I got a fast rise, and I ended up being the developer
   chief of the project, and I became conceited and proud. I was a young engineer leading
   groups of people around 10 years older than me, only because my boss graduated from the
   same university I graduated from, so he had plenty of confidence in my manners. I was
   becoming better and better everyday in that job, and I liked it, so it became a priority for me,
   but I’m a person who tries new things, and pretends everything is ok when it is not. That part
   of my brain that has that odd mania of wanting to feel more “refined” led me to take French
   classes, because only god knows english and spanish are not enough to explore the world.
</p>
<p align="justify">
   I had already filled out the whole room, and the bed wasn't there yet, so far I had to
   take my regular university classes plus an extra French class, go to my full time job, and
   work on my thesis project. When I realized what was coming, honestly, I felt a lot of stress.
   We were living in the pandemia era, so the world wasn’t having its regular days for that time.
   There was a curfew, so driving at any time of the day wasn't possible. The capability in many
   places was less, and a lot of people were locked down in their homes. The covid-19
   pandemia definitely is a historical event that changed the world, because for a moment it felt
   like the world stopped. I felt that sensation too, but I didn’t have the chance to stop. Being an
   engineer has been my dream for the last five years. I don’t care if the deers were in the
   streets instead of the cars, or if the dolphins were in the bays instead of the boats. I got a
   goal, and no microorganism was going to stop me.

   Some night, in the middle of my silence. When the screen of my computer was
   looking at me, I wasn’t looking at it. I was having a bad time trying to figure out my ongoing
   situation, as Abraham jack said “College can be a difficult time for everyone”, yes it has been
   a difficult time. For three weeks, I had been working on what I thought was going to be my
   thesis project. I wanted to do something meaningful, something that could combat an evil
   that affects my country. I decided to develop an educational game that could help people
   with scarce resources, to learn how to code. These days, knowing something as
   programming, can be the differential factor that can make you earn some dollars from an
   American company looking for more cheapers developers. Luckily, dollars have more value
   in our Latin American economies. I was delighted with the idea. Something I can feel proud
   of, but time was lacking, and my performance was poor. I definitely had a problem, in my
   hands

   Am I going to make it? As Hughes wrote, “What happens to a dream deferred? Does
   it dry up…like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore— And then run?” I was walking
   someday alongside my boss talking about the company’s project. He was satisfied and
   excited for the coming project phases. He didn’t notice the same satisfaction in me. Probably
   he thought; Why is this young developer not satisfied? after having developed a whole
   software for his country’s airport, is an opportunity that everybody in his position would like to
   have. As matter of fact, he didn’t think that, he asked me that. I was honest. I talked about
   how I was worried because I wasn’t having a good time with my ongoing thesis project, how
   the time had become a problem, and the months were finishing. Humans we are beings of
   perspectives. “Why would you develop two projects at the same time? When you only need
   one for two different purposes?” he asked. I answered with my idealistic idea of making a
   thesis that can change the country, and just using the logic he made me realize. Is good to
   have ideals, they are the standard of excellence, but pragmatism will make your life move
   forward, and eventually will take you to reach your ideals. “Take this project, prepare it, do
   whatever you have to do, and get your thesis ready on time” he said. I realized that what he
   was saying was true, so I decided to use my job project as my thesis as well. At that
   moment, I became an engineer.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  It was true, I had a great product on my hands, and I wasn’t taking advantage of it.
   Now, years later, in another country, I still remember that project with pride, because even
   when I know there are many things I could make better, that was the project that began
   everything somehow, but the young engineer I was, he wasn’t seeing it, until that moment. I
   stayed up the nights I had to stay up, and I got the feedback that I had to get, and I talked
   with the people that I had to talk with, and I coded the code that I had to code, and fixed the
   bugs that I had to fix. In conclusion, I did what I had to do. I finished that project, and I
   named it after the model of plane my pilot grandparent used to fly. Project Arava:
   automatization for airport environments was ready to be defended.

  As the warrior, I was there. Nervous but ready. Lacking a creature to fight, but with a
   trio of professionals in front of me ready to evaluate me. I don’t know why, but in those
   colminatory moments, time just feels different. I talked and I answered. I showed and I
   explained, and finally I had to wait. In those fifthteen minutes that felt like hours, the trio
   discussed if I was going to become an engineer. Eventually, they let me in, and with great joy
   they gave me the good news. I have made it. I don’t even remember who was the first
   person I called, or the first congratulation that I heard, but I do remember I kept alone some
   minutes after hearing the verdict, just enjoying the moment. I really enjoyed it. Now, I
   remember this with nostalgia, something that I began several years ago, finally have done.
   Moments like that always remind me why I must keep going, even when the sun doesn't
   shine every day, because I still have a lot of things to do, now that I finished that first step
   called university.
